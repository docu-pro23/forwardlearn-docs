- Bridges traditional risk
management framework (RMF) documentation and modern DevSecOps practices.<br>

- Docs-as-code principles.<br>
- Git version control.<br>
- CI/CD for automatic deployment.<br>
- SAST/IAST/DAST methodology.<br>
- The NIST 800-53 RMF.<br> 

The portfolio:<br>
- Demonstrates my understanding of Git and docs-as-code.<br>
- Demonstrates my understanding of RMF and DevSecOps.<br>
- Aligns system security plan (SSP) and software design document (SDD) sections.<br>
- Includes RMF controls and architectural integration points.<br>
- Maps security practices to pipeline stages.<br>
