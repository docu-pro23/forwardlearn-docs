Project-Based Learning Portfolio by Shawn Blanchard<br>
DevSecOps cATO documentation portfolio using Git, Docusaurus, and NIST RMF<br>

- This portfolio demonstrates cATO (continuous Authorization to Operate) documentation knowledge by implementing living security documentation. 
- It bridges traditional RMF (risk managment framework) documentation and modern DevSecOps practices to show how automated evidence collection can feed compliance documentation.<br> 

The portfolio includes detailed security documentation to show my understanding of RMF controls, DevSecOps integration, and cATO concepts. It uses:<br>
- Docs-as-code principles.<br>
- Git version control.<br>
- CI/CD for automatic deployment.<br>
- SAST/IAST/DAST methods.<br>
- The NIST 800-53 RMF.<br> 

The portfolio:<br>
- Demonstrates my understanding of Git and docs-as-code.<br>
- Demonstrates my understanding of RMF and DevSecOps.<br>
- Combines an SSP and an SDD.<br>
- Includes RMF control tailoring and integration points.<br>
- Maps security practices to pipeline stages.<br>
- Shows continuous monitoring for compliance.<br>
